### Embion v0.01_11 ###

Latest Updates:
- Added a "disclaimer" upon entering the server. Simply close it by pressing ESC or X 
- Added a new pistol - Shoots a bit differently than the classic pistol
- Added a Knife sound effect - For this I used the OnCollision event, depending on what was hit, it will play a sound-effect.
- Fixed sound effects a bit, but they still rarely play accordingly.
- Fixed ammo display - Now displays only when you are wielding a gun.
